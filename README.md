# Gloveone-Unity-Leap
This is just a rudimentary implementation of Gloveone's C# .dll in Unity, alongside Leap Motion's plugin.
I will try & make a more fleshed-out gloveone component later on, but for now, feel free to look at & mess around with the source.
The example scene was built around VR in mind, but you can remove it. The gloveone scripts are attached to the leap motion hands' fingertips.

For now, the example script just simply vibrates the relevant fingertip when the collider on them hits another collider.

Pre-requisite:
- Unity 2018 (specifically 2018.1.9f1) or above
- ND Suite (Link as of 30/08/2018: https://www.neurodigital.es/developer/)
